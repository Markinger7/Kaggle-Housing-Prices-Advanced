## Goal of the competition
It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

## Motivation
After learning data analytics and data science over 7 months now. I wanted to apply what I learned on a dataset that offers a lot of possibilitys to implement creative feature enginniering and advanced machine learning models to predict the sale price of a house.


## Data
- 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
- data is split into train and test 

## What did I do?
I first made a jupyter notebook to explore the dataset, performed various preprocessing steps and visualized the featurs to select the ones I wanted to use in the final machine learning model. After I explored the dataset and tested the code i created a second notebook to only show the neccessary steps and to focus more on the machine learning models. Till now I have implemented all the preprocessing and made the first predictions with the basic algorithems and a simple blended model
